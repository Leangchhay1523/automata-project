- overview:

    - Converts a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) to a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) using the subset construction algorithm.

- process:

    - Extract Components: Takes a Finite Automaton (fa) and extracts its name, type, states, alphabet, transitions, startState, and acceptStates using destructuring.

    - Check if Already DFA: If the FA is marked as a DFA (type === "DFA") or has no ε-transitions and no non-deterministic transitions (multiple targets per symbol), returns the FA unchanged.

    - Initialize DFA: Creates a new DFA with:

        - Name: DFA_${name}

        - Type: "DFA"

        - Alphabet: Excludes ε from the NFA's alphabet
        
        - Empty states, transitions, and accept states

    - Handle Start State: Computes the ε-closure of the NFA's start state to form the DFA's initial state. Names it (e.g., q'0) and adds it to the DFA's states and queue.

    - Subset Construction:

        - Processes each state set in the queue.

        - For each symbol in the DFA's alphabet, collects reachable states from the current state set.

        - Computes the ε-closure of reachable states to form a new state set.

        - If the new state set is unique, creates a new DFA state (e.g., q'1), adds it to states and queue, and checks if it contains NFA accept states to update DFA accept states.

        - Sets the DFA transition from the current state to the new state for the symbol.

    - Repeat: Continues until the queue is empty, ensuring all reachable state sets are processed.

    - Return: Outputs the constructed DFA with deterministic transitions.
        
- output: Returns a DFA object equivalent to the input NFA, with no ε-transitions and exactly one target state per symbol per state.
