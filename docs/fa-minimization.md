- Input:
    
    - dfa: An object representing the original DFA with properties like states, alphabet, transitions, startState, and acceptStates.
        
    - partitions: An array of Set objects, where each Set contains states that behave equivalently.
        
- Process:
    
    1. Creates new state names (Q0, Q1, etc.) for each partition, with Q0 for the group containing the original start state.
        
    2. Maps original states to new state names.
        
    3. Identifies new accept states based on whether any state in a group was an accept state.
        
    4. Builds transitions for each new state using a representative state from each group.
        
    5. Returns a new DFA object with updated states, transitions, start state, and accept states.
        
- Output: A new DFA object with fewer states, maintaining the same language acceptance as the original DFA.
